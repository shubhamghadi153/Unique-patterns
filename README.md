# Pattern Program

This Python program generates various visual patterns using nested loops and conditional statements. Each section demonstrates unique patterns based on different loop conditions, showcasing the versatility of loops in Python.

## Patterns Included

1. **Repeated Numbers:**
    - Prints a grid of repeated numbers.

2. **Right-Aligned Triangle:**
    - Prints a right-aligned triangle of increasing numbers.

3. **Sequence Grid:**
    - Prints a grid with sequences from 1 to `n`.

4. **Decreasing Sequences:**
    - Prints decreasing sequences from `n` to `1`.

5. **Inverted Triangle:**
    - Prints an inverted triangle of numbers.

6. **Diagonal Patterns:**
    - Prints a diagonal pattern with numbers and dashes.

7. **Cross Diagonal Patterns:**
    - Prints cross-diagonal patterns with numbers.

8. **Mixed Patterns:**
    - Combines various characters and symbols to create complex patterns.
